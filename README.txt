#What it does

It gives personalized low-cost dietary options with the help of Gemini API, it takes a series of parameters to give a highly personalized and customizable meal plan.

#How we built it

We used Python for the front and back ends with the help of StreamLit to create a seamless interaction of both ends. We also had to use some HTML for the formatting of the web page. We used Google Gemini API to create the response of the bot.
